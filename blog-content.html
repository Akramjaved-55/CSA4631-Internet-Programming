                <h2>THENI</h2>
                <img src="blog/1.jpeg">
                <p>The word ‘Theni’ is derived from the Tamil ‘Then’ meaning honey or nectar. A visit to Theni in Tamil Nadu is likely to remain a sweet memory for you. Theni district broke away from Madurai in 1996 and the district headquarters is the town of Theni. It is one of the most verdant and beautiful parts of the state. The paddy, cotton, and tea production is facilitated by rivers and creeks that crisscross the district. The natural beauty and cultural richness of Theni have prompted the moniker, “Earth’s Hidden Paradise”.</p>
                <p>Not only is Theni beautiful, it is also a bustling centre for cotton trade and a region full of significant religious shrines. Theni is a historically important region. Right from the times when the Fish Flag of the Pandya Kings flew over Madurai and all neighboring regions, up to the times of Tipu Sultan’s southern campaign and the British rule, Theni has lent its brilliance to the history of the state</p>
                <h3>Places To Visit</h3>
                <p><b>Meghamalai</b> (75 km from Theni), literally translated into Cloud Mountain, is one of the most green and verdant parts of Tamil Nadu. Apart from the sprawling tea gardens, the wildlife sanctuary here is worth visiting. Gaur, elephants, barking deer, boars, bears, foxes, and otters are sighted here. Over 100 species of birds are found in this wildlife sanctuary.<br><br>

                   <b> Suruli Falls</b> (56 km from Theni) is a beautiful cascading waterfall that you will want to visit. Tourists often bathe in the waters which are said to have healing properties. The caves near the Suruli Falls are classic examples of the superlative rock architecture of early Tamils.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Kumbakkarai Falls</b> (23 km from Theni) on Pambar River was developed by Thiru K Chellam Iyer, a generous resident of the region. The beautiful staged falls and the natural rock formations in the vicinity are a must-visit.</p>

                        <img src="blog/2.jpg">
                        <p>Los Angeles was the kind of place where everybody was from somewhere else and nobody really droppped anchor. It was a transient place. People drawn by the dream, people running from the nightmare. Twelve million people and all of them ready to make a break for it if necessary. Figuratively, literally, metaphorically -- any way you want to look at it -- everbody in L.A. keeps a bag packed. Just in case.</p>
                        <p>I could hear everything, together with the hum of my hotel neon. I never felt sadder in my life. LA is the loneliest and most brutal of American cities; New York gets godawful cold in the winter but there's a feeling of wacky comradeship somewhere in some streets. LA is a jungle.</p>
